    <p>This village of art is the work of Grandpa Rainbow, a former soldier Huang Yung-Fu. He picked up his paintbrush years ago to brighten up his environs. The whole village is a canvas; animals, flowers and cartoons adorn not only the walls but also the ground, enveloping visitors in a bright, cheery setting. </p>
